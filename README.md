# AI-MEDICAL-ASSISTANT
AI Medical Assistant is an advanced, multimodal AI system designed to analyze medical images, process voice queries, and provide real-time health insights. By leveraging state-of-the-art large language models, computer vision, and speech processing, it enhances accessibility to medical knowledge through an interactive and intelligent interface.
Overview:
The AI Medical Assistant is an advanced multimodal system designed to process voice and text inputs for healthcare-related queries. By integrating state-of-the-art language models, speech recognition, and text-to-speech technologies, the system provides intelligent, real-time medical insights. This project aims to enhance accessibility to healthcare information through an interactive and efficient AI-powered interface.

Features
	•	Voice-Based Interaction: Processes spoken queries using Whisper, PyAudio, and FFmpeg for seamless communication.
	•	Text-Based Query Handling: Generates intelligent, context-aware medical responses using LLaMA 3 90B (Groq Cloud).
	•	Text-to-Speech Synthesis: Converts AI-generated insights into natural speech using ElevenLabs and gTTS.
	•	User-Friendly Interface: Built with Gradio, providing an interactive and accessible platform for users.

Technology Stack
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Large Language Models (LLMs): LLaMA 3 90B (Groq Cloud)
	•	Speech Processing: OpenAI Whisper, FFmpeg, PyAudio
